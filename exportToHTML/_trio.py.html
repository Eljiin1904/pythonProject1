<span class="s2">class </span><span class="s1">TrioEventEmitter(EventEmitter):</span>
    <span class="s4">&quot;&quot;&quot;An event emitter class which can run trio tasks in a trio nursery. 
 
    By default, this class will lazily create both a nursery manager (the 
    object returned from ``trio.open_nursery()`` and a nursery (the object 
    yielded by using the nursery manager as an async context manager). It is 
    also possible to supply an existing nursery manager via the ``manager`` 
    argument, or an existing nursery via the ``nursery`` argument. 
 
    Instances of TrioEventEmitter are themselves async context managers, so 
    that they may manage the lifecycle of the underlying trio nursery. For 
    example, typical usage of this library may look something like this:: 
 
        async with TrioEventEmitter() as ee: 
            # Underlying nursery is instantiated and ready to go 
            @ee.on('data') 
            async def handler(data): 
                print(data) 
 
            ee.emit('event') 
 
        # Underlying nursery and manager have been cleaned up 
 
    Unlike the case with the BaseEventEmitter, all exceptions raised by event 
    handlers are automatically emitted on the ``error`` event. This is 
    important for trio coroutines specifically but is also handled for 
    synchronous functions for consistency. 
 
    For trio coroutine event handlers, calling emit is non-blocking. In other 
    words, you should not attempt to await emit; the coroutine is scheduled 
    in a fire-and-forget fashion.
