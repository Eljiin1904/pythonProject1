    <span class="s5">&quot;&quot;&quot;A helper to create instances of an event emitter ``cls`` that inherits 
    event behavior from an ``underlying`` event emitter instance. 
 
    This is mostly helpful if you have a simple underlying event emitter 
    that you don't have direct control over, but you want to use that 
    event emitter in a new context - for example, you may want to ``uplift`` a 
    ``BaseEventEmitter`` supplied by a third party library into an 
    ``AsyncIOEventEmitter`` so that you may register async event handlers 
    in your ``asyncio`` app but still be able to receive events from the 
    underlying event emitter and call the underlying event emitter's existing 
    handlers. This trick will also often work for a deprecated 
    ``EventEmitter`` instance. 
 
    When called, ``uplift`` instantiates a new instance of ``cls``, passing 
    along any unrecognized arguments, and overwrites the ``emit`` method on 
    the ``underlying`` event emitter to also emit events on the new event 
    emitter and vice versa. In both cases, they return whether the ``emit`` 
    method was handled by either emitter. Execution order prefers the event 
    emitter on which ``emit`` was called. 
 
    ``uplift`` also adds an ``unwrap`` method to both instances, either of 
    which will unwrap both ``emit`` methods when called. 
 
    The ``error_handling`` flag can be configured to control what happens to 
    unhandled errors: 
 
    - 'new': Error handling for the new event emitter is always used and the 
      underlying library's non-event-based error handling is inert. 
    - 'underlying': Error handling on the underlying event emitter is always 
      used and the new event emitter can not implement non-event-based error 
      handling. 
    - 'neither': Error handling for the new event emitter is used if the 
      handler was registered on the new event emitter, and vice versa. 
 
    Tuning this option can be useful depending on how the underlying event 
    emitter does error handling. The default is 'new'. 
 
    The ``proxy_new_listener`` option can be configured to control how 
    ``new_listener`` events are treated: 
 
    - 'forward': ``new_listener`` events are propagated from the underlying 
    - 'both': ``new_listener`` events are propagated as with other events. 
    - 'neither': ``new_listener`` events are only fired on their respective 
      event emitters. 
      event emitter to the new event emitter but not vice versa. 
    - 'backward': ``new_listener`` events are propagated from the new event 
      emitter to the underlying event emitter, but not vice versa. 
 
    Tuning this option can be useful depending on how the ``new_listener`` 
    event is used by the underlying event emitter, if at all. The default is 
    'forward', since ``underlying`` may not know how to handle certain 
    handlers, such as asyncio coroutines. 
 
    Each event emitter tracks its own internal table of handlers. 
    ``remove_listener``, ``remove_all_listeners`` and ``listeners`` all 
    work independently. This means you will have to remember which event 
    emitter an event handler was added to! 
 
    Note that both the new event emitter returned by ``cls`` and the 
    underlying event emitter should inherit from ``BaseEventEmitter``, or at 
    least implement the interface for the undocumented ``_call_handlers`` and 
    ``_emit_handle_potential_error`` methods.
