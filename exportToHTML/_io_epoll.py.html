<span class="s3"># Some facts about epoll</span>
<span class="s3"># ----------------------</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Internally, an epoll object is sort of like a WeakKeyDictionary where the</span>
<span class="s3"># keys are tuples of (fd number, file object). When you call epoll_ctl, you</span>
<span class="s3"># pass in an fd; that gets converted to an (fd number, file object) tuple by</span>
<span class="s3"># looking up the fd in the process's fd table at the time of the call. When an</span>
<span class="s3"># event happens on the file object, epoll_wait drops the file object part, and</span>
<span class="s3"># just returns the fd number in its event. So from the outside it looks like</span>
<span class="s3"># it's keeping a table of fds, but really it's a bit more complicated. This</span>
<span class="s3"># has some subtle consequences.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># In general, file objects inside the kernel are reference counted. Each entry</span>
<span class="s3"># in a process's fd table holds a strong reference to the corresponding file</span>
<span class="s3"># object, and most operations that use file objects take a temporary strong</span>
<span class="s3"># reference while they're working. So when you call close() on an fd, that</span>
<span class="s3"># might or might not cause the file object to be deallocated -- it depends on</span>
<span class="s3"># whether there are any other references to that file object. Some common ways</span>
<span class="s3"># this can happen:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># - after calling dup(), you have two fds in the same process referring to the</span>
<span class="s3">#   same file object. Even if you close one fd (= remove that entry from the</span>
<span class="s3">#   fd table), the file object will be kept alive by the other fd.</span>
<span class="s3"># - when calling fork(), the child inherits a copy of the parent's fd table,</span>
<span class="s3">#   so all the file objects get another reference. (But if the fork() is</span>
<span class="s3">#   followed by exec(), then all of the child's fds that have the CLOEXEC flag</span>
<span class="s3">#   set will be closed at that point.)</span>
<span class="s3"># - most syscalls that work on fds take a strong reference to the underlying</span>
<span class="s3">#   file object while they're using it. So there's one thread blocked in</span>
<span class="s3">#   read(fd), and then another thread calls close() on the last fd referring</span>
<span class="s3">#   to that object, the underlying file won't actually be closed until</span>
<span class="s3">#   after read() returns.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># However, epoll does *not* take a reference to any of the file objects in its</span>
<span class="s3"># interest set (that's what makes it similar to a WeakKeyDictionary). File</span>
<span class="s3"># objects inside an epoll interest set will be deallocated if all *other*</span>
<span class="s3"># references to them are closed. And when that happens, the epoll object will</span>
<span class="s3"># automatically deregister that file object and stop reporting events on it.</span>
<span class="s3"># So that's quite handy.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># But, what happens if we do this?</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3">#   fd1 = open(...)</span>
<span class="s3">#   epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd1, ...)</span>
<span class="s3">#   fd2 = dup(fd1)</span>
<span class="s3">#   close(fd1)</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># In this case, the dup() keeps the underlying file object alive, so it</span>
<span class="s3"># remains registered in the epoll object's interest set, as the tuple (fd1,</span>
<span class="s3"># file object). But, fd1 no longer refers to this file object! You might think</span>
<span class="s3"># there was some magic to handle this, but unfortunately no; the consequences</span>
<span class="s3"># are totally predictable from what I said above:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># If any events occur on the file object, then epoll will report them as</span>
<span class="s3"># happening on fd1, even though that doesn't make sense.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Perhaps we would like to deregister fd1 to stop getting nonsensical events.</span>
<span class="s3"># But how? When we call epoll_ctl, we have to pass an fd number, which will</span>
<span class="s3"># get expanded to an (fd number, file object) tuple. We can't pass fd1,</span>
<span class="s3"># because when epoll_ctl tries to look it up, it won't find our file object.</span>
<span class="s3"># And we can't pass fd2, because that will get expanded to (fd2, file object),</span>
<span class="s3"># which is a different lookup key. In fact, it's *impossible* to de-register</span>
<span class="s3"># this fd!</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># We could even have fd1 get assigned to another file object, and then we can</span>
<span class="s3"># have multiple keys registered simultaneously using the same fd number, like:</span>
<span class="s3"># (fd1, file object 1), (fd1, file object 2). And if events happen on either</span>
<span class="s3"># file object, then epoll will happily report that something happened to</span>
<span class="s3"># &quot;fd1&quot;.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Now here's what makes this especially nasty: suppose the old file object</span>
<span class="s3"># becomes, say, readable. That means that every time we call epoll_wait, it</span>
<span class="s3"># will return immediately to tell us that &quot;fd1&quot; is readable. Normally, we</span>
<span class="s3"># would handle this by de-registering fd1, waking up the corresponding call to</span>
<span class="s3"># wait_readable, then the user will call read() or recv() or something, and</span>
<span class="s3"># we're fine. But if this happens on a stale fd where we can't remove the</span>
<span class="s3"># registration, then we might get stuck in a state where epoll_wait *always*</span>
<span class="s3"># returns immediately, so our event loop becomes unable to sleep, and now our</span>
<span class="s3"># program is burning 100% of the CPU doing nothing, with no way out.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># What does this mean for Trio?</span>
<span class="s3"># -----------------------------</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Since we don't control the user's code, we have no way to guarantee that we</span>
<span class="s3"># don't get stuck with stale fd's in our epoll interest set. For example, a</span>
<span class="s3"># user could call wait_readable(fd) in one task, and then while that's</span>
<span class="s3"># running, they might close(fd) from another task. In this situation, they're</span>
<span class="s3"># *supposed* to call notify_closing(fd) to let us know what's happening, so we</span>
<span class="s3"># can interrupt the wait_readable() call and avoid getting into this mess. And</span>
<span class="s3"># that's the only thing that can possibly work correctly in all cases. But</span>
<span class="s3"># sometimes user code has bugs. So if this does happen, we'd like to degrade</span>
<span class="s3"># gracefully, and survive without corrupting Trio's internal state or</span>
<span class="s3"># otherwise causing the whole program to explode messily.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Our solution: we always use EPOLLONESHOT. This way, we might get *one*</span>
<span class="s3"># spurious event on a stale fd, but then epoll will automatically silence it</span>
<span class="s3"># until we explicitly say that we want more events... and if we have a stale</span>
<span class="s3"># fd, then we actually can't re-enable it! So we can't get stuck in an</span>
<span class="s3"># infinite busy-loop. If there's a stale fd hanging around, then it might</span>
<span class="s3"># cause a spurious `BusyResourceError`, or cause one wait_* call to return</span>
<span class="s3"># before it should have... but in general, the wait_* functions are allowed to</span>
<span class="s3"># have some spurious wakeups; the user code will just attempt the operation,</span>
<span class="s3"># get EWOULDBLOCK, and call wait_* again. And the program as a whole will</span>
<span class="s3"># survive, any exceptions will propagate, etc.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># As a bonus, EPOLLONESHOT also saves us having to explicitly deregister fds</span>
<span class="s3"># on the normal wakeup path, so it's a bit more efficient in general.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># However, EPOLLONESHOT has a few trade-offs to consider:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># First, you can't combine EPOLLONESHOT with EPOLLEXCLUSIVE. This is a bit sad</span>
<span class="s3"># in one somewhat rare case: if you have a multi-process server where a group</span>
<span class="s3"># of processes all share the same listening socket, then EPOLLEXCLUSIVE can be</span>
<span class="s3"># used to avoid &quot;thundering herd&quot; problems when a new connection comes in. But</span>
<span class="s3"># this isn't too bad. It's not clear if EPOLLEXCLUSIVE even works for us</span>
<span class="s3"># anyway:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3">#   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41582560/how-does-epolls-epollexclusive-mode-interact-with-level-triggering</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># And it's not clear that EPOLLEXCLUSIVE is a great approach either:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3">#   https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing/</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># And if we do need to support this, we could always add support through some</span>
<span class="s3"># more-specialized API in the future. So this isn't a blocker to using</span>
<span class="s3"># EPOLLONESHOT.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Second, EPOLLONESHOT does not actually *deregister* the fd after delivering</span>
<span class="s3"># an event (EPOLL_CTL_DEL). Instead, it keeps the fd registered, but</span>
<span class="s3"># effectively does an EPOLL_CTL_MOD to set the fd's interest flags to</span>
<span class="s3"># all-zeros. So we could still end up with an fd hanging around in the</span>
<span class="s3"># interest set for a long time, even if we're not using it.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Fortunately, this isn't a problem, because it's only a weak reference – if</span>
<span class="s3"># we have a stale fd that's been silenced by EPOLLONESHOT, then it wastes a</span>
<span class="s3"># tiny bit of kernel memory remembering this fd that can never be revived, but</span>
<span class="s3"># when the underlying file object is eventually closed, that memory will be</span>
<span class="s3"># reclaimed. So that's OK.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># The other issue is that when someone calls wait_*, using EPOLLONESHOT means</span>
<span class="s3"># that if we have ever waited for this fd before, we have to use EPOLL_CTL_MOD</span>
<span class="s3"># to re-enable it; but if it's a new fd, we have to use EPOLL_CTL_ADD. How do</span>
<span class="s3"># we know which one to use? There's no reasonable way to track which fds are</span>
<span class="s3"># currently registered -- remember, we're assuming the user might have gone</span>
<span class="s3"># and rearranged their fds without telling us!</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Fortunately, this also has a simple solution: if we wait on a socket or</span>
<span class="s3"># other fd once, then we'll probably wait on it lots of times. And the epoll</span>
<span class="s3"># object itself knows which fds it already has registered. So when an fd comes</span>
<span class="s3"># in, we optimistically assume that it's been waited on before, and try doing</span>
<span class="s3"># EPOLL_CTL_MOD. And if that fails with an ENOENT error, then we try again</span>
<span class="s3"># with EPOLL_CTL_ADD.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># So that's why this code is the way it is. And now you know more than you</span>
<span class="s3"># wanted to about how epoll works.</span>
