<span class="s3"># There's a lot to be said about the overall design of a Windows event</span>
<span class="s3"># loop. See</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3">#    https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/52</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># for discussion. This now just has some lower-level notes:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># How IOCP fits together:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># The general model is that you call some function like ReadFile or WriteFile</span>
<span class="s3"># to tell the kernel that you want it to perform some operation, and the</span>
<span class="s3"># kernel goes off and does that in the background, then at some point later it</span>
<span class="s3"># sends you a notification that the operation is complete. There are some more</span>
<span class="s3"># exotic APIs that don't quite fit this pattern, but most APIs do.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Each background operation is tracked using an OVERLAPPED struct, that</span>
<span class="s3"># uniquely identifies that particular operation.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># An &quot;IOCP&quot; (or &quot;I/O completion port&quot;) is an object that lets the kernel send</span>
<span class="s3"># us these notifications -- basically it's just a kernel-&gt;userspace queue.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Each IOCP notification is represented by an OVERLAPPED_ENTRY struct, which</span>
<span class="s3"># contains 3 fields:</span>
<span class="s3"># - The &quot;completion key&quot;. This is an opaque integer that we pick, and use</span>
<span class="s3">#   however is convenient.</span>
<span class="s3"># - pointer to the OVERLAPPED struct for the completed operation.</span>
<span class="s3"># - dwNumberOfBytesTransferred (an integer).</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># And in addition, for regular I/O, the OVERLAPPED structure gets filled in</span>
<span class="s3"># with:</span>
<span class="s3"># - result code (named &quot;Internal&quot;)</span>
<span class="s3"># - number of bytes transferred (named &quot;InternalHigh&quot;); usually redundant</span>
<span class="s3">#   with dwNumberOfBytesTransferred.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># There are also some other entries in OVERLAPPED which only matter on input:</span>
<span class="s3"># - Offset and OffsetHigh which are inputs to {Read,Write}File and</span>
<span class="s3">#   otherwise always zero</span>
<span class="s3"># - hEvent which is for if you aren't using IOCP; we always set it to zero.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># That describes the usual pattern for operations and the usual meaning of</span>
<span class="s3"># these struct fields, but really these are just some arbitrary chunks of</span>
<span class="s3"># bytes that get passed back and forth, so some operations like to overload</span>
<span class="s3"># them to mean something else.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># You can also directly queue an OVERLAPPED_ENTRY object to an IOCP by calling</span>
<span class="s3"># PostQueuedCompletionStatus. When you use this you get to set all the</span>
<span class="s3"># OVERLAPPED_ENTRY fields to arbitrary values.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># You can request to cancel any operation if you know which handle it was</span>
<span class="s3"># issued on + the OVERLAPPED struct that identifies it (via CancelIoEx). This</span>
<span class="s3"># request might fail because the operation has already completed, or it might</span>
<span class="s3"># be queued to happen in the background, so you only find out whether it</span>
<span class="s3"># succeeded or failed later, when we get back the notification for the</span>
<span class="s3"># operation being complete.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># There are three types of operations that we support:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># == Regular I/O operations on handles (e.g. files or named pipes) ==</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Implemented by: register_with_iocp, wait_overlapped</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># To use these, you have to register the handle with your IOCP first. Once</span>
<span class="s3"># it's registered, any operations on that handle will automatically send</span>
<span class="s3"># completion events to that IOCP, with a completion key that you specify *when</span>
<span class="s3"># the handle is registered* (so you can't use different completion keys for</span>
<span class="s3"># different operations).</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># We give these two dedicated completion keys: CKeys.WAIT_OVERLAPPED for</span>
<span class="s3"># regular operations, and CKeys.LATE_CANCEL that's used to make</span>
<span class="s3"># wait_overlapped cancellable even if the user forgot to call</span>
<span class="s3"># register_with_iocp. The problem here is that after we request the cancel,</span>
<span class="s3"># wait_overlapped keeps blocking until it sees the completion notification...</span>
<span class="s3"># but if the user forgot to register_with_iocp, then the completion will never</span>
<span class="s3"># come, so the cancellation will never resolve. To avoid this, whenever we try</span>
<span class="s3"># to cancel an I/O operation and the cancellation fails, we use</span>
<span class="s3"># PostQueuedCompletionStatus to send a CKeys.LATE_CANCEL notification. If this</span>
<span class="s3"># arrives before the real completion, we assume the user forgot to call</span>
<span class="s3"># register_with_iocp on their handle, and raise an error accordingly.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># == Socket state notifications ==</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Implemented by: wait_readable, wait_writable</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># The public APIs that windows provides for this are all really awkward and</span>
<span class="s3"># don't integrate with IOCP. So we drop down to a lower level, and talk</span>
<span class="s3"># directly to the socket device driver in the kernel, which is called &quot;AFD&quot;.</span>
<span class="s3"># Unfortunately, this is a totally undocumented internal API. Fortunately</span>
<span class="s3"># libuv also does this, so we can be pretty confident that MS won't break it</span>
<span class="s3"># on us, and there is a *little* bit of information out there if you go</span>
<span class="s3"># digging.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Basically: we open a magic file that refers to the AFD driver, register the</span>
<span class="s3"># magic file with our IOCP, and then we can issue regular overlapped I/O</span>
<span class="s3"># operations on that handle. Specifically, the operation we use is called</span>
<span class="s3"># IOCTL_AFD_POLL, which lets us pass in a buffer describing which events we're</span>
<span class="s3"># interested in on a given socket (readable, writable, etc.). Later, when the</span>
<span class="s3"># operation completes, the kernel rewrites the buffer we passed in to record</span>
<span class="s3"># which events happened, and uses IOCP as normal to notify us that this</span>
<span class="s3"># operation has completed.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># Unfortunately, the Windows kernel seems to have bugs if you try to issue</span>
<span class="s3"># multiple simultaneous IOCTL_AFD_POLL operations on the same socket (see</span>
<span class="s3"># notes-to-self/afd-lab.py). So if a user calls wait_readable and</span>
<span class="s3"># wait_writable at the same time, we have to combine those into a single</span>
<span class="s3"># IOCTL_AFD_POLL. This means we can't just use the wait_overlapped machinery.</span>
<span class="s3"># Instead we have some dedicated code to handle these operations, and a</span>
<span class="s3"># dedicated completion key CKeys.AFD_POLL.</span>

<span class="s3"># - The WSAEventSelect docs (this exposes a finer-grained set of events than</span>
<span class="s3">#   select(), so if you squint you can treat it as a source of information on</span>
<span class="s3">#   the fine-grained AFD poll types)</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># == Everything else ==</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># There are also some weirder APIs for interacting with IOCP. For example, the</span>
<span class="s3"># &quot;Job&quot; API lets you specify an IOCP handle and &quot;completion key&quot;, and then in</span>
<span class="s3"># the future whenever certain events happen it sends uses IOCP to send a</span>
<span class="s3"># notification. These notifications don't correspond to any particular</span>
<span class="s3"># operation; they're just spontaneous messages you get. The</span>
<span class="s3"># &quot;dwNumberOfBytesTransferred&quot; field gets repurposed to carry an identifier</span>
<span class="s3"># for the message type (e.g. JOB_OBJECT_MSG_EXIT_PROCESS), and the</span>
<span class="s3"># &quot;lpOverlapped&quot; field gets repurposed to carry some arbitrary data that</span>
<span class="s3"># depends on the message type (e.g. the pid of the process that exited).</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># To handle these, we have monitor_completion_key, where we hand out an</span>
<span class="s3"># unassigned completion key, let users set it up however they want, and then</span>
<span class="s3"># get any events that arrive on that key.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># (Note: monitor_completion_key is not documented or fully baked; expect it to</span>
<span class="s3"># change in the future.)</span>

<span class="s3"># everyone waiting on the *handle* wakes up, which is what you'd expect.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># However, we can't avoid getting LOCAL_CLOSE notifications -- the kernel</span>
<span class="s3"># delivers them whether we ask for them or not -- so better to include them</span>
