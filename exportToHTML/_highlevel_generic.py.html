<span class="s0">async def </span><span class="s1">aclose_forcefully(resource):</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Close an async resource or async generator immediately, without 
    blocking to do any graceful cleanup. 
 
    :class:`~trio.abc.AsyncResource` objects guarantee that if their 
    :meth:`~trio.abc.AsyncResource.aclose` method is cancelled, then they will 
    still close the resource (albeit in a potentially ungraceful 
    fashion). :func:`aclose_forcefully` is a convenience function that 
    exploits this behavior to let you force a resource to be closed without 
    blocking: it works by calling ``await resource.aclose()`` and then 
    cancelling it immediately. 
 
    Most users won't need this, but it may be useful on cleanup paths where 
    you can't afford to block, or if you want to close a resource and don't 
    care about handling it gracefully. For example, if 
    :class:`~trio.SSLStream` encounters an error and cannot perform its 
    own graceful close, then there's no point in waiting to gracefully shut 
    down the underlying transport either, so it calls ``await 
    aclose_forcefully(self.transport_stream)``. 
 
    Note that this function is async, and that it acts as a checkpoint, but 
    unlike most async functions it cannot block indefinitely (at least, 
    assuming the underlying resource object is correctly implemented).

    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;This class `staples &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_(fastener)&gt;`__ 
    together two unidirectional streams to make single bidirectional stream. 
 
    Args: 
      send_stream (~trio.abc.SendStream): The stream to use for sending. 
      receive_stream (~trio.abc.ReceiveStream): The stream to use for 
          receiving. 
 
    Example: 
 
       A silly way to make a stream that echoes back whatever you write to 
       it:: 
 
          left, right = trio.testing.memory_stream_pair() 
          echo_stream = StapledStream(SocketStream(left), SocketStream(right)) 
          await echo_stream.send_all(b&quot;x&quot;) 
          assert await echo_stream.receive_some() == b&quot;x&quot; 
 
    :class:`StapledStream` objects implement the methods in the 
    :class:`~trio.abc.HalfCloseableStream` interface. They also have two 
    additional public attributes: 
 
    .. attribute:: send_stream 
 
       The underlying :class:`~trio.abc.SendStream`. :meth:`send_all` and 
       :meth:`wait_send_all_might_not_block` are delegated to this object. 
 
    .. attribute:: receive_stream 
 
       The underlying :class:`~trio.abc.ReceiveStream`. :meth:`receive_some` 
       is delegated to this object.
