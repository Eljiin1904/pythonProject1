    <span class="s5">&quot;&quot;&quot;Convert a blocking operation into an async operation using a thread. 
 
    These two lines are equivalent:: 
 
        sync_fn(*args) 
        await trio.to_thread.run_sync(sync_fn, *args) 
 
    except that if ``sync_fn`` takes a long time, then the first line will 
    block the Trio loop while it runs, while the second line allows other Trio 
    tasks to continue working while ``sync_fn`` runs. This is accomplished by 
    pushing the call to ``sync_fn(*args)`` off into a worker thread. 
 
    From inside the worker thread, you can get back into Trio using the 
    functions in `trio.from_thread`. 
 
    Args: 
      sync_fn: An arbitrary synchronous callable. 
      *args: Positional arguments to pass to sync_fn. If you need keyword 
          arguments, use :func:`functools.partial`. 
      cancellable (bool): Whether to allow cancellation of this operation. See 
          discussion below. 
      limiter (None, or CapacityLimiter-like object): 
          An object used to limit the number of simultaneous threads. Most 
          commonly this will be a `~trio.CapacityLimiter`, but it could be 
          anything providing compatible 
          :meth:`~trio.CapacityLimiter.acquire_on_behalf_of` and 
          :meth:`~trio.CapacityLimiter.release_on_behalf_of` methods. This 
          function will call ``acquire_on_behalf_of`` before starting the 
          thread, and ``release_on_behalf_of`` after the thread has finished. 
 
          If None (the default), uses the default `~trio.CapacityLimiter`, as 
          returned by :func:`current_default_thread_limiter`. 
 
    **Cancellation handling**: Cancellation is a tricky issue here, because 
    neither Python nor the operating systems it runs on provide any general 
    mechanism for cancelling an arbitrary synchronous function running in a 
    thread. This function will always check for cancellation on entry, before 
    starting the thread. But once the thread is running, there are two ways it 
    can handle being cancelled: 
 
    * If ``cancellable=False``, the function ignores the cancellation and 
      keeps going, just like if we had called ``sync_fn`` synchronously. This 
      is the default behavior. 
 
    * If ``cancellable=True``, then this function immediately raises 
      `~trio.Cancelled`. In this case **the thread keeps running in 
      background** – we just abandon it to do whatever it's going to do, and 
      silently discard any return value or errors that it raises. Only use 
      this if you know that the operation is safe and side-effect free. (For 
      example: :func:`trio.socket.getaddrinfo` uses a thread with 
      ``cancellable=True``, because it doesn't really affect anything if a 
      stray hostname lookup keeps running in the background.) 
 
      The ``limiter`` is only released after the thread has *actually* 
      finished – which in the case of cancellation may be some time after this 
      function has returned. If :func:`trio.run` finishes before the thread 
      does, then the limiter release method will never be called at all. 
 
    .. warning:: 
 
       You should not use this function to call long-running CPU-bound 
       functions! In addition to the usual GIL-related reasons why using 
       threads for CPU-bound work is not very effective in Python, there is an 
       additional problem: on CPython, `CPU-bound threads tend to &quot;starve out&quot; 
       IO-bound threads &lt;https://bugs.python.org/issue7946&gt;`__, so using 
       threads for CPU-bound work is likely to adversely affect the main 
       thread running Trio. If you need to do this, you're better off using a 
       worker process, or perhaps PyPy (which still has a GIL, but may do a 
       better job of fairly allocating CPU time between threads). 
 
    Returns: 
      Whatever ``sync_fn(*args)`` returns. 
 
    Raises: 
      Exception: Whatever ``sync_fn(*args)`` raises.
