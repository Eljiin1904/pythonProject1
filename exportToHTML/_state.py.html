<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Rule 1: everything that affects the state machine and state transitions must</span>
<span class="s0"># live here in this file. As much as possible goes into the table-based</span>
<span class="s0"># representation, but for the bits that don't quite fit, the actual code and</span>
<span class="s0"># state must nonetheless live here.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Rule 2: this file does not know about what role we're playing; it only knows</span>
<span class="s0"># about HTTP request/response cycles in the abstract. This ensures that we</span>
<span class="s0"># don't cheat and apply different rules to local and remote parties.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Theory of operation</span>
<span class="s0"># ===================</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Possibly the simplest way to think about this is that we actually have 5</span>
<span class="s0"># different state machines here. Yes, 5. These are:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># 1) The client state, with its complicated automaton (see the docs)</span>
<span class="s0"># 2) The server state, with its complicated automaton (see the docs)</span>
<span class="s0"># 3) The keep-alive state, with possible states {True, False}</span>
<span class="s0"># 4) The SWITCH_CONNECT state, with possible states {False, True}</span>
<span class="s0"># 5) The SWITCH_UPGRADE state, with possible states {False, True}</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># For (3)-(5), the first state listed is the initial state.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># (1)-(3) are stored explicitly in member variables. The last</span>
<span class="s0"># two are stored implicitly in the pending_switch_proposals set as:</span>
<span class="s0">#   (state of 4) == (_SWITCH_CONNECT in pending_switch_proposals)</span>
<span class="s0">#   (state of 5) == (_SWITCH_UPGRADE in pending_switch_proposals)</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># And each of these machines has two different kinds of transitions:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># a) Event-triggered</span>
<span class="s0"># b) State-triggered</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Event triggered is the obvious thing that you'd think it is: some event</span>
<span class="s0"># happens, and if it's the right event at the right time then a transition</span>
<span class="s0"># happens. But there are somewhat complicated rules for which machines can</span>
<span class="s0"># &quot;see&quot; which events. (As a rule of thumb, if a machine &quot;sees&quot; an event, this</span>
<span class="s0"># means two things: the event can affect the machine, and if the machine is</span>
<span class="s0"># not in a state where it expects that event then it's an error.) These rules</span>
<span class="s0"># are:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># 1) The client machine sees all h11.events objects emitted by the client.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># 2) The server machine sees all h11.events objects emitted by the server.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#    It also sees the client's Request event.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#    And sometimes, server events are annotated with a _SWITCH_* event. For</span>
<span class="s0">#    example, we can have a (Response, _SWITCH_CONNECT) event, which is</span>
<span class="s0">#    different from a regular Response event.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># 3) The keep-alive machine sees the process_keep_alive_disabled() event</span>
<span class="s0">#    (which is derived from Request/Response events), and this event</span>
<span class="s0">#    transitions it from True -&gt; False, or from False -&gt; False. There's no way</span>
<span class="s0">#    to transition back.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># 4&amp;5) The _SWITCH_* machines transition from False-&gt;True when we get a</span>
<span class="s0">#    Request that proposes the relevant type of switch (via</span>
<span class="s0">#    process_client_switch_proposals), and they go from True-&gt;False when we</span>
<span class="s0">#    get a Response that has no _SWITCH_* annotation.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># So that's event-triggered transitions.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># State-triggered transitions are less standard. What they do here is couple</span>
<span class="s0"># the machines together. The way this works is, when certain *joint*</span>
<span class="s0"># configurations of states are achieved, then we automatically transition to a</span>
<span class="s0"># new *joint* state. So, for example, if we're ever in a joint state with</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#   client: DONE</span>
<span class="s0">#   keep-alive: False</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># then the client state immediately transitions to:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#   client: MUST_CLOSE</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># This is fundamentally different from an event-based transition, because it</span>
<span class="s0"># doesn't matter how we arrived at the {client: DONE, keep-alive: False} state</span>
<span class="s0"># -- maybe the client transitioned SEND_BODY -&gt; DONE, or keep-alive</span>
<span class="s0"># transitioned True -&gt; False. Either way, once this precondition is satisfied,</span>
<span class="s0"># this transition is immediately triggered.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># What if two conflicting state-based transitions get enabled at the same</span>
<span class="s0"># time?  In practice there's only one case where this arises (client DONE -&gt;</span>
<span class="s0"># MIGHT_SWITCH_PROTOCOL versus DONE -&gt; MUST_CLOSE), and we resolve it by</span>
<span class="s0"># explicitly prioritizing the DONE -&gt; MIGHT_SWITCH_PROTOCOL transition.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Implementation</span>
<span class="s0"># --------------</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># The event-triggered transitions for the server and client machines are all</span>
<span class="s0"># stored explicitly in a table. Ditto for the state-triggered transitions that</span>
<span class="s0"># involve just the server and client state.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># The transitions for the other machines, and the state-triggered transitions</span>
<span class="s0"># that involve the other machines, are written out as explicit Python code.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># It'd be nice if there were some cleaner way to do all this. This isn't</span>
<span class="s0"># *too* terrible, but I feel like it could probably be better.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># WARNING</span>
<span class="s0"># -------</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># The script that generates the state machine diagrams for the docs knows how</span>
<span class="s0"># to read out the EVENT_TRIGGERED_TRANSITIONS and STATE_TRIGGERED_TRANSITIONS</span>
<span class="s0"># tables. But it can't automatically read the transitions that are written</span>
<span class="s0"># directly in Python code. So if you touch those, you need to also update the</span>
<span class="s0"># script to keep it in sync!</span>
