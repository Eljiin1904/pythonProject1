    <span class="s5">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
    Represents a stream given the file descriptor to a pipe, TTY, etc. 
 
    *fd* must refer to a file that is open for reading and/or writing and 
    supports non-blocking I/O (pipes and TTYs will work, on-disk files probably 
    not).  The returned stream takes ownership of the fd, so closing the stream 
    will close the fd too.  As with `os.fdopen`, you should not directly use 
    an fd after you have wrapped it in a stream using this function. 
 
    To be used as a Trio stream, an open file must be placed in non-blocking 
    mode.  Unfortunately, this impacts all I/O that goes through the 
    underlying open file, including I/O that uses a different 
    file descriptor than the one that was passed to Trio. If other threads 
    or processes are using file descriptors that are related through `os.dup` 
    or inheritance across `os.fork` to the one that Trio is using, they are 
    unlikely to be prepared to have non-blocking I/O semantics suddenly 
    thrust upon them.  For example, you can use 
    ``FdStream(os.dup(sys.stdin.fileno()))`` to obtain a stream for reading 
    from standard input, but it is only safe to do so with heavy caveats: your 
    stdin must not be shared by any other processes and you must not make any 
    calls to synchronous methods of `sys.stdin` until the stream returned by 
    `FdStream` is closed. See `issue #174 
    &lt;https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/174&gt;`__ for a discussion of the 
    challenges involved in relaxing this restriction. 
 
    Args: 
      fd (int): The fd to be wrapped. 
 
    Returns: 
      A new `FdStream` object.
