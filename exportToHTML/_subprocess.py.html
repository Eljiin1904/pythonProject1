<span class="s2">class </span><span class="s1">Process(AsyncResource</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="s1">metaclass=NoPublicConstructor):</span>
    <span class="s5">r&quot;&quot;&quot;A child process. Like :class:`subprocess.Popen`, but async. 
 
    This class has no public constructor. To create a child process, use 
    `open_process`:: 
 
       process = await trio.open_process(...) 
 
    `Process` implements the `~trio.abc.AsyncResource` interface. In order to 
    make sure your process doesn't end up getting abandoned by mistake or 
    after an exception, you can use ``async with``:: 
 
       async with await trio.open_process(...) as process: 
           ... 
 
    &quot;Closing&quot; a :class:`Process` will close any pipes to the child and wait 
    for it to exit; if cancelled, the child will be forcibly killed and we 
    will ensure it has finished exiting before allowing the cancellation to 
    propagate. 
 
    Attributes: 
      args (str or list): The ``command`` passed at construction time, 
          specifying the process to execute and its arguments. 
      pid (int): The process ID of the child process managed by this object. 
      stdin (trio.abc.SendStream or None): A stream connected to the child's 
          standard input stream: when you write bytes here, they become available 
          for the child to read. Only available if the :class:`Process` 
          was constructed using ``stdin=PIPE``; otherwise this will be None. 
      stdout (trio.abc.ReceiveStream or None): A stream connected to 
          the child's standard output stream: when the child writes to 
          standard output, the written bytes become available for you 
          to read here. Only available if the :class:`Process` was 
          constructed using ``stdout=PIPE``; otherwise this will be None. 
      stderr (trio.abc.ReceiveStream or None): A stream connected to 
          the child's standard error stream: when the child writes to 
          standard error, the written bytes become available for you 
          to read here. Only available if the :class:`Process` was 
          constructed using ``stderr=PIPE``; otherwise this will be None. 
      stdio (trio.StapledStream or None): A stream that sends data to 
          the child's standard input and receives from the child's standard 
          output. Only available if both :attr:`stdin` and :attr:`stdout` are 
          available; otherwise this will be None.

        By convention, a return code of zero indicates success.  On 
        UNIX, negative values indicate termination due to a signal, 
        e.g., -11 if terminated by signal 11 (``SIGSEGV``).  On 
        Windows, a process that exits due to a call to 
        :meth:`Process.terminate` will have an exit status of 1. 
 
        Unlike the standard library `subprocess.Popen.returncode`, you don't 
        have to call `poll` or `wait` to update this attribute; it's 
        automatically updated as needed, and will always give you the latest

<span class="s1">) -&gt; Process:</span>
    <span class="s5">r&quot;&quot;&quot;Execute a child program in a new process. 
 
    After construction, you can interact with the child process by writing 
    data to its `~Process.stdin` stream (a `~trio.abc.SendStream`), reading 
    data from its `~Process.stdout` and/or `~Process.stderr` streams (both 
    `~trio.abc.ReceiveStream`\s), sending it signals using 
    `~Process.terminate`, `~Process.kill`, or `~Process.send_signal`, and 
    waiting for it to exit using `~Process.wait`. See `Process` for details. 
 
    Each standard stream is only available if you specify that a pipe should 
    be created for it. For example, if you pass ``stdin=subprocess.PIPE``, you 
    can write to the `~Process.stdin` stream, else `~Process.stdin` will be 
    ``None``. 
 
    Args: 
      command (list or str): The command to run. Typically this is a 
          sequence of strings such as ``['ls', '-l', 'directory with spaces']``, 
          where the first element names the executable to invoke and the other 
          elements specify its arguments. With ``shell=True`` in the 
          ``**options``, or on Windows, ``command`` may alternatively 
          be a string, which will be parsed following platform-dependent 
          :ref:`quoting rules &lt;subprocess-quoting&gt;`. 
      stdin: Specifies what the child process's standard input 
          stream should connect to: output written by the parent 
          (``subprocess.PIPE``), nothing (``subprocess.DEVNULL``), 
          or an open file (pass a file descriptor or something whose 
          ``fileno`` method returns one). If ``stdin`` is unspecified, 
          the child process will have the same standard input stream 
          as its parent. 
      stdout: Like ``stdin``, but for the child process's standard output 
          stream. 
      stderr: Like ``stdin``, but for the child process's standard error 
          stream. An additional value ``subprocess.STDOUT`` is supported, 
          which causes the child's standard output and standard error 
          messages to be intermixed on a single standard output stream, 
          attached to whatever the ``stdout`` option says to attach it to. 
      **options: Other :ref:`general subprocess options &lt;subprocess-options&gt;` 
          are also accepted. 
 
    Returns: 
      A new `Process` object. 
 
    Raises: 
      OSError: if the process spawning fails, for example because the 
         specified command could not be found.

    <span class="s5">&quot;&quot;&quot;Run ``command`` in a subprocess, wait for it to complete, and 
    return a :class:`subprocess.CompletedProcess` instance describing 
    the results. 
 
    If cancelled, :func:`run_process` terminates the subprocess and 
    waits for it to exit before propagating the cancellation, like 
    :meth:`Process.aclose`. 
 
    **Input:** The subprocess's standard input stream is set up to 
    receive the bytes provided as ``stdin``.  Once the given input has 
    been fully delivered, or if none is provided, the subprocess will 
    receive end-of-file when reading from its standard input. 
    Alternatively, if you want the subprocess to read its 
    standard input from the same place as the parent Trio process, you 
    can pass ``stdin=None``. 
 
    **Output:** By default, any output produced by the subprocess is 
    passed through to the standard output and error streams of the 
    parent Trio process. If you would like to capture this output and 
    do something with it, you can pass ``capture_stdout=True`` to 
    capture the subprocess's standard output, and/or 
    ``capture_stderr=True`` to capture its standard error.  Captured 
    data is provided as the 
    :attr:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stdout` and/or 
    :attr:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stderr` attributes of the 
    returned :class:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess` object.  The value 
    for any stream that was not captured will be ``None``. 
 
    If you want to capture both stdout and stderr while keeping them 
    separate, pass ``capture_stdout=True, capture_stderr=True``. 
 
    If you want to capture both stdout and stderr but mixed together 
    in the order they were printed, use: ``capture_stdout=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT``. 
    This directs the child's stderr into its stdout, so the combined 
    output will be available in the `~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stdout` 
    attribute. 
 
    **Error checking:** If the subprocess exits with a nonzero status 
    code, indicating failure, :func:`run_process` raises a 
    :exc:`subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception rather than 
    returning normally. The captured outputs are still available as 
    the :attr:`~subprocess.CalledProcessError.stdout` and 
    :attr:`~subprocess.CalledProcessError.stderr` attributes of that 
    exception.  To disable this behavior, so that :func:`run_process` 
    returns normally even if the subprocess exits abnormally, pass 
    ``check=False``. 
 
    Args: 
      command (list or str): The command to run. Typically this is a 
          sequence of strings such as ``['ls', '-l', 'directory with spaces']``, 
          where the first element names the executable to invoke and the other 
          elements specify its arguments. With ``shell=True`` in the 
          ``**options``, or on Windows, ``command`` may alternatively 
          be a string, which will be parsed following platform-dependent 
          :ref:`quoting rules &lt;subprocess-quoting&gt;`. 
 
      stdin (:obj:`bytes`, file descriptor, or None): The bytes to provide to 
          the subprocess on its standard input stream, or ``None`` if the 
          subprocess's standard input should come from the same place as 
          the parent Trio process's standard input. As is the case with 
          the :mod:`subprocess` module, you can also pass a 
          file descriptor or an object with a ``fileno()`` method, 
          in which case the subprocess's standard input will come from 
          that file. 
 
      capture_stdout (bool): If true, capture the bytes that the subprocess 
          writes to its standard output stream and return them in the 
          :attr:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stdout` attribute 
          of the returned :class:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess` object. 
 
      capture_stderr (bool): If true, capture the bytes that the subprocess 
          writes to its standard error stream and return them in the 
          :attr:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stderr` attribute 
          of the returned :class:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess` object. 
 
      check (bool): If false, don't validate that the subprocess exits 
          successfully. You should be sure to check the 
          ``returncode`` attribute of the returned object if you pass 
          ``check=False``, so that errors don't pass silently. 
 
      deliver_cancel (async function or None): If `run_process` is cancelled, 
          then it needs to kill the child process. There are multiple ways to 
          do this, so we let you customize it. 
 
          If you pass None (the default), then the behavior depends on the 
          platform: 
 
          - On Windows, Trio calls ``TerminateProcess``, which should kill the 
            process immediately. 
 
          - On Unix-likes, the default behavior is to send a ``SIGTERM``, wait 
            5 seconds, and send a ``SIGKILL``. 
 
          Alternatively, you can customize this behavior by passing in an 
          arbitrary async function, which will be called with the `Process` 
          object as an argument. For example, the default Unix behavior could 
          be implemented like this:: 
 
             async def my_deliver_cancel(process): 
                 process.send_signal(signal.SIGTERM) 
                 await trio.sleep(5) 
                 process.send_signal(signal.SIGKILL) 
 
          When the process actually exits, the ``deliver_cancel`` function 
          will automatically be cancelled – so if the process exits after 
          ``SIGTERM``, then we'll never reach the ``SIGKILL``. 
 
          In any case, `run_process` will always wait for the child process to 
          exit before raising `Cancelled`. 
 
      **options: :func:`run_process` also accepts any :ref:`general subprocess 
          options &lt;subprocess-options&gt;` and passes them on to the 
          :class:`~trio.Process` constructor. This includes the 
          ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` options, which provide additional 
          redirection possibilities such as ``stderr=subprocess.STDOUT``, 
          ``stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL``, or file descriptors. 
 
    Returns: 
      A :class:`subprocess.CompletedProcess` instance describing the 
      return code and outputs. 
 
    Raises: 
      UnicodeError: if ``stdin`` is specified as a Unicode string, rather 
          than bytes 
      ValueError: if multiple redirections are specified for the same 
          stream, e.g., both ``capture_stdout=True`` and 
          ``stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL`` 
      subprocess.CalledProcessError: if ``check=False`` is not passed 
          and the process exits with a nonzero exit status 
      OSError: if an error is encountered starting or communicating with 
          the process 
 
    .. note:: The child process runs in the same process group as the parent 
       Trio process, so a Ctrl+C will be delivered simultaneously to both 
       parent and child. If you don't want this behavior, consult your 
       platform's documentation for starting child processes in a different 
       process group.
